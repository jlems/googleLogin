#Google login application for EC 500 C1

Release notes:
Using the googleapi as a skeleton for our application, we made an 
application that signs you in to your google account across all applications 
on your phone. Specifically, we added functionality where the user can see 
their google profile picture when they are signed into the application. 
Furthermore, the user is greeted with a welcome message and their name is 
displayed on the screen as well. The user can also sign out from their 
account and they can sign into other google accounts using the same 
application.
